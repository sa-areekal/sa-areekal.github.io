[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hey there,\nI am a graduate student working in the Goel Lab at IISER Pune, under the guidance of Dr. Pranay Goel.\nI currently study growth processes in Indian children with mentorship from Dr. Anuradha Khadilkar, HCJMRI Pune and Prof. Tim J Cole, UCL GOS ICH. We have created growth centiles and longitudinal models for height in Indian children aged 5 to 18 years based on data from Pune school-children. They are made available as a web-app growHT.\nIt won’t be wrong to say that I use concrete biological contexts to understand statistical, mathematical and data science concepts, and nurture my quantitative thinking abilities (it’s meagre). Currently, I am trying to get a grasp on Multilevel models.\nI am an R language enthusiast and enjoys working with Tidyverse, RMarkdown, Blogdown and Shiny. Check out easy-to-use Shiny web-app growHT, that helps to monitor height growth in Indian children aged 6 to 18 years, currently hosted on Shiny Server.\nIn my free time, I play badminton, read books, watch football, and movies. I do suffer from slight smart-phone addiction mainly to Mint, Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/sandra-aravind-areekal/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sandra-aravind-areekal/","section":"authors","summary":"Hey there,\nI am a graduate student working in the Goel Lab at IISER Pune, under the guidance of Dr. Pranay Goel.\nI currently study growth processes in Indian children with mentorship from Dr.","tags":null,"title":"Sandra Aravind Areekal","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
