Hey there,

I am a graduate student in the [Goel Lab](https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/) at IISER Pune, working with [Dr Pranay Goel](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/biology/people/faculty/regular-faculty/pranay-goel/271). 
Currently, I study growth processes in Indian children in collaboration with [Dr Anuradha Khadilkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anuradha-Khadilkar-2), [HCJMRI Pune](https://www.hcjmri.org.in/) and [Prof. Tim J Cole](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1P_yQocAAAAJ&hl=en), [UCL GOS ICH](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/). We have recently created growth centiles and longitudinal models for height growth in Indian children based on data from Pune school children. Check out our easy-to-use Shiny web app [_growHT_](https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/growth-charts) to monitor height growth in Indian children aged 5 to 18 years. 

I am interested in applying quantitative methods to study human physiology, especially maternal and child health. Studying concrete biological problems in this manner also provides contexts for me to learn many statistical, mathematical and data science concepts that don’t make much sense to me otherwise. Currently, I am trying to get a grasp on [Multilevel models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model).

I am an R language enthusiast and enjoy working with Tidyverse, RMarkdown, Blogdown and Shiny. I also work with specific R packages [SITAR](https://rdrr.io/cran/sitar/man/sitar.html) and [GAMLSS](https://www.gamlss.com/) for my research. 


I play badminton, read books, and watch football and movies in my free time. I suffer from slight smartphone addiction, mainly to Mint, Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube.
