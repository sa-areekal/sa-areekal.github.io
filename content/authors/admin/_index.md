Hey there,

I am a graduate student working in the [Goel Lab](https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/) at IISER Pune under the guidance of [Dr Pranay Goel](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/biology/people/faculty/regular-faculty/pranay-goel/271).

I currently study growth processes in Indian children with mentorship from [Dr Anuradha Khadilkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anuradha-Khadilkar-2), [HCJMRI Pune](https://www.hcjmri.org.in/) and [Prof. Tim J Cole](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1P_yQocAAAAJ&hl=en), [UCL GOS ICH](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/). We have created growth centiles and longitudinal models for height in Indian children aged 6 to 18 years based on data from Pune school-children. They are made available as a web-app [growHT](https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/growth-charts).

Studying concrete biological contexts helps me better understand statistical, mathematical and data science concepts that don't make much sense to me otherwise. Currently, I am trying to get a grasp on [multilevel models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model).

I am an R language enthusiast and enjoys working with Tidyverse, RMarkdown, Blogdown and Shiny. Check out our easy-to-use Shiny web app [growHT](http://210.212.192.176:3838/growHT/), which helps to monitor height growth in Indian children aged 6 to 18 years, currently hosted on Shiny Server.

I play badminton, read books, and watch football and movies in my free time. I suffer from slight smart-phone addiction, mainly to Mint, Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube.
