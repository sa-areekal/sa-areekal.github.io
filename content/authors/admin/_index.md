Hey there,

I am a graduate student working in the [Goel Lab](https://digimed.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/) at IISER Pune, under the guidance of [Dr. Pranay Goel](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/biology/people/faculty/regular-faculty/pranay-goel/271).

I currently study growth processes in Indian children with mentorship from [Dr. Anuradha Khadilkar, HCJMRI Pune](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anuradha-Khadilkar-2) and [Prof. Tim J Cole, UCL GOS ICH](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1P_yQocAAAAJ&hl=en). We have created growth centiles and longitudinal models for height in Indian children aged 5 to 18 years based on data from Pune school-children. They are made available as a web-app [growHT](http://210.212.192.176:3838/growHT/).   


 It won't be wrong to say that I use concrete biological contexts to understand statistical, mathematical and data science concepts, and nurture my quantitative thinking abilities (it's meagre). Currently, I am trying to get a grasp on [Multilevel models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model).

 I am an R language enthusiast and enjoys working with Tidyverse, RMarkdown, Blogdown and Shiny. Check out easy-to-use Shiny web-app [growHT](http://210.212.192.176:3838/growHT/), that helps to monitor height growth in Indian children aged 6 to 18 years, currently hosted on Shiny Server. 

 In my free time, I play badminton, read books, watch football, and movies. I do suffer from slight smart-phone addiction mainly to Mint, Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube.
